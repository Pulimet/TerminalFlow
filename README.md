# What is Terminal Flow?
Terminal Flow is a VS Code extension that lets you save, organize, and execute shell commands and multi-step workflows without ever leaving your editor. Commands are stored as simple JSON files inside your project, so you can commit them to Git and share them with your entire team.

## ✨ Features

### 📂 Project-Based Storage
Commands and flows are stored in `.terminal/commands.json` and `.terminal/flows.json` in your workspace root. Commit them to Git and share with your team.

### 👤 Personal Storage
Manage your private commands and flows in a global `~/.terminal` folder. Toggle between Workspace and Personal views to keep your environment organized.


### ⚡️ One-Click Execution
Run complex shell commands instantly from the sidebar — no need to remember or retype them.

### 🔍 Quick Pick Execution
Use the **Terminal Flow: Search and Run** command from the command palette to instantly find and run your commands or flows without opening the sidebar.

### 📝 Variable Interpolation
Use variables like `$filename` or `$branch` in your commands. Terminal Flow will prompt you to fill in these values before execution, making your commands reusable and dynamic.

### 🔗 Command Flows
Chain multiple commands together into reproducible workflows (e.g., *Build → Test → Deploy*). Commands execute sequentially, each waiting for the previous to succeed.

### ⏱ Built-in Sleep & Echo
Insert **sleep** (with configurable delay) and **echo** (with custom messages) steps directly into flows — no need to create separate commands for them.

### ⚡️ Async Execution
Configure individual commands or entire flows to run in their own dedicated terminal windows, allowing parallel execution alongside your main work.

### ⏯ Flexible Flows
Start your flows from any step in the sequence using the "Run from here" (⬇) button.

### 🎨 Modern UI
Clean, React-based sidebar interface that blends seamlessly with your VS Code theme. Categories are collapsible and remember their state.

### 🔍 Smart Search
Instantly filter your commands and flows. Search works across titles, descriptions, and even the command code itself.

### ↕️ Easy Organization
Keep your workspace tidy by reordering both categories and individual commands using the up/down controls.

### 🔄 Live Sync
Edit the JSON files directly or use the UI — both stay in sync instantly via file watchers.

### 📤 Export & Import
Easily backup or share your commands and flows. Supports exporting individual items or your entire collection, with automatic dependency handling for flows.

### 📋 Copy to Clipboard
Copy any command's shell text in one click. For flows, copy individual step commands or the entire flow sequence as a single shell script.

### 🔁 Duplicate
Quickly duplicate existing commands or flows as a starting point for new ones.

### 🔒 Protected Command Deletion
When attempting to delete a command that is used by one or more flows, the extension warns you and lists the affected flows — preventing accidental breakage.

## 📁 File Structure

Terminal Flow stores everything in a `.terminal` folder at your workspace root:

```
.terminal/
├── commands.json          # Your saved commands
├── flows.json             # Your saved workflows
├── commandCategories.json # Order of command categories
└── flowCategories.json    # Order of flow categories
```

Personal commands are stored in your home directory:
```
~/.terminal/
├── commands.json
├── flows.json
...
```

> **Tip**: Commit this folder to Git so your team shares the same commands and workflows.
